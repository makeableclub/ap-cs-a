Recursion

1. Basics:

- base
- condition leading to base
- do something while in each recursive call
- in each recursion, do something before, or after the recursive call?
- base, or leading to base may not be obvious

2. Wall through of recursion:
Function call, and function stack!

Fibonacci number:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

3. Recursion of 2-dimension matrix
- masking green color
- recursion on matrix, e.g. edge layer -> going into the middle core

4. Good or bad?
- could be very clean, easier to reason, and concise code
- tree traversal is a natural fit
- searching & sorting algorithm (binary search, merge sort)
- tricky, not leading to base (infinite), stack overflow, memory overflow
